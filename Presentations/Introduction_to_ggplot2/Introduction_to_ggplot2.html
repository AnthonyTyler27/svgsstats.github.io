# Installing the needed packages

Much of this course makes use of a special group of R packages referred to as the *tidyverse*.  The *tidyverse* is a set of packages that work in harmony with each other because they share a common design. 

To install the *tidyverse* on your machine, run this command from your console. 


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You won't need to run this command again on this machine. 

--

Open up a new R script in your RStudio window. 

---
# Loading the Package

In order to access any of the functions, we need to first load the library into the R session.  You'll always need to do this first whenever using ggplot. 


```r
library(ggplot2)
```

--

For these practice problems, we're going to make use of a dataset that is built into ggplot called `mpg`.

Use the help feature of RStudio to read about what this data set represents. 

--


```r
?mpg 
```

You can also use RStudio's View() function to get an idea of what is actually in this dataset. 

---
# ggplot2 Basics

**ggplot2** is based on the **grammar of graphics**, the idea that you can build every graph from the same few components:
- a data set
- a set of geoms (visual marks that represent data points)
- a coordinate system

![:scale 60%](3comps.png)

To display the data values, we map variables in the data set to aesthetic properties of the geom like **size**, **color**, and **x**/**y** locations. 

---
# Our first plot

Run the following command in your R Console. 


```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

--

# Structure of a call to ggplot


```r
ggplot(                     )
```

Note that we first called ggplot. 
---
# Structure of a call to ggplot


```r
ggplot(mpg,                 )
```

Note that we first called ggplot.

The first argument is the name of the dataset.

---
# Structure of a call to ggplot


```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
```

Note that we first called ggplot.

The first argument is the name of the dataset.

The second argument is a call to aes()

---
# Aesthetics

Aesthetics are mappings of visual attributes of the graph to variables.  There are many different aesthetics, but the ones we will most commonly use are: 
- x, y
- color
- fill
- linetype
- size
- etc.

---
# Structure of a call to ggplot


```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```


We then add a layer to the graph.  Layers are specific types of geoms.

--

Other geoms include: 
- geom_density()
- geom_dotplot()
- geom_histogram()
- geom_bar()
- geom_boxplot()
- etc.

---
class: inverse, center, middle
# You try!

### See if you can construct a scatterplot between the city miles per gallon and the highway miles per gallon in the mpg dataset.

---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Try another!

### R has a built-in dataset by the name of `faithful`.  View the help file description of the dataset, and use the View() function to inspect it. 

### Construct a scatterplot of eruptions vs waiting

---
# Adding labeling

Using the `labs()` function we can add a layer of labels.


```r
ggplot(faithful,aes(x=eruptions,y=waiting)) + 
  geom_point() +
   labs(x="Eruption time in minutes",
       y="Time between eruptions in minutes",
       title="Eruption Time vs Waiting time (in minutes)", 
       caption="based on data from Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA")
```

# Aesthetic fun

We can map a 3rd dimension onto our scatterplot through use of **color**.


```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=class)) +
  geom_point()
```

--

![](Introduction_to_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Aesthetic fun

We can alter the labeling of that color scale too. 

```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=class)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(color = "Class of Vehicle")
```

![](Introduction_to_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Aesthetic fun

If you want to take the regular points and color them differently, then you can set the color inside of the geom_point() layer. 


```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+
  geom_point(color="darkblue")
```

--

![](Introduction_to_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---
# Aesthetic fun

You probably want to know what kind of colors are even available don't you?

See [this link](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)!

You can also make custom colors by utililizing the rgb function. 
Like this:  `rgb(1,1,0)`

---
# Aesthetic fun

Size is another attribute that can be helpful to alter at times. 

Just like with color, if you change it within the aes function, then it will map size to a variable in the dataset (you can create points with differing sizes).  If you just want all of the points to be bigger or smaller, then you can set the size to be a constant within the geom_point() layer. 


```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ,y=hwy))+
  geom_point(size=4)
```

![](Introduction_to_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Aesthetic fun

There's a variable in the dataset that's called `cyl` that represents how many cylinders the car engine has.   See if you can construct a graph that has different sized points based on this variable.   It should look like this one:

![](Introduction_to_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---
# Aesthetic fun

If you're not a fan of the gray background with white lines, then you can easily change this.  `ggplot` has some built in graph themes that you may like better. Here's one: 


```r
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=class)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() 
```

![](Introduction_to_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Aesthetic fun

Other themes include: 
- theme_bw()
- theme_linedraw()
- theme_light()
- theme_dark()
- theme_minimal()
- theme_classic()
- or, you can download other R packages that contain additional themes and/or customize individual components of the theme yourself. 
- One of my favorite packages for ggplot themes is called `ggthemes`.  You  can install it like you did the `tidyverse` and then utilize a number of other themes.

---
# theme_fivethirtyeight()


```r
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=class)) +
  geom_point() + 
* theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

![](Introduction_to_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---
# Curve fitting

At times, we want to show the general shape of the dataset.  The `geom_smooth()` layer will let you do that.   Add this layer to the old faithful scatterplot you made earlier. 

--

![](Introduction_to_ggplot2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Line fitting

The `geom_smooth()` layer can also fit a line (a linear model) to the data.  Just use `method = lm`  in the call. 

` ... +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
`

---
# Try your hand at it!

This graph is made using the `iris` dataset built into R.  Perhaps you should take a `View()` of it first.
