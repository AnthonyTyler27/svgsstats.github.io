# General Course Information

--

- Syllabus can be downloaded from [Canvas](https://svgs.instructure.com/courses/203). Read it. 

--


- This course will utilize three different online textbooks  
(which can all be found on [Canvas](https://svgs.instructure.com/courses/203))

--

  - OpenIntro Statistics

--

  - ModernDive:  An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R
  
--

  - R for Data Science

--

- All course content can be found on [Canvas](https://svgs.instructure.com/courses/203).  Be sure to reference the calendar, so you can stay up on due dates.

--

- All communication with the instructor should be done using the Canvas messenger or e-mail (tylera@svgs.k12.va.us).  You are expected to check Canvas messenger and your e-mail each school day.

# What will this course be like? 

--

- ### Statistics is **not** like other math classes

--

- ### Spiral approach

--

- ### Variety of small projects throughout the course

---
# Technology Needs

- We will utilize both ![:scale 5%](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg) and ![:scale 10%](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gradient.png)
in this course.  

--
  
  R is the software that will do most of our statistical heavy lifting.  RStudio is software that will make R a *little* more user friendly for us. 
  
--

- We will also use ![:scale 5%](https://banner2.kisspng.com/20180331/bce/kisspng-microsoft-excel-microsoft-project-logo-microsoft-w-excel-5abfec581e5118.3452195915225273201242.jpg) at times.

--

- All software is free for students.  
  
  Reference the [SVGS Student Resources](https://svgs.instructure.com/courses/163) page for instructions on how to download Microsoft Office to your personal computer.  
  
  Reference the Statistics course page for instructions on how to download and install R and RStudio.
  
  Classroom desktops have all needed software, so you don't need your own computer (though it's recommended)

### an industry ready tool,

### and allows for reproducible research.

---

# What is reproducible research? 

--

> ### “[T]he code and data are assembled in a way so that another group can re-create all of the results (e.g., the figures in a paper). Adopting a workflow that will make your results reproducible will ultimately make your life easier; if a problem (or question) arises somewhere down the line, it will be much easier to correct (or explain).”  
### - Karl Broman

--

### Why do you think that's important?

---

# Excel

### - Widely used with 750 million users

### - Combines data input, wrangling, modeling, visualization, and output in one document

### - Not reproducible

# What is statistics?



---
# What is statistics?

--

- ### Statistics is the **science** of data. 

--

- ### It deals with collecting, summarizing, visualizing, analyzing, predicting, and communicating the data. 

--

- ### Statistics studies *uncertainty*.

# What is Data?

--

- ### Data are (*data* is the plural of *datum*) everywhere!  You will have to make decisions based on data, or evaluate decisions someone else has made based on data in every field. 

--

- ### Data are a set of measurements taken on a set of individual units.

--

- ### Data is typically stored and presented in a dataset, comprised of **variables** measured on **cases**.

# Countries of the World
```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
x <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year==2007) %>% 
  select(-year) %>%
  rename(lifeExpectancy=lifeExp,population=pop,gdp_per_capita=gdpPercap);

knitr::kable(head(x,10), format = 'html')
```

# Countries of the World

- Variables are either classified as **categorical** or **quantitative**
--
  
  
  - A **quantitative** variable measures a numerical quantity for each case.
--
  
  
  - A **categorical** variable divides cases into groups.
--
  
  
  - In the countries of the world data set, which variables are categorical and which are quantitative?
```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(x,4),format='html')
```
  
---
# Countries of the World
```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=12}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=x,aes(x=log(gdp_per_capita),y=lifeExpectancy))+geom_point(aes(color=continent),size=6)+
  labs(x="log of GDP",y="Life Expectancy")+
 theme_minimal() + theme(text=element_text(size=15))

```

### Countries of the World
```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.width=10}
summaryData <- group_by(x,continent) %>% summarize(lifeExp = mean(lifeExpectancy))
USAvalue = x %>% filter(country=="United States") %>% select(lifeExpectancy)
USAvalue = as.numeric(USAvalue)
ggplot(data=summaryData,aes(x=continent))+geom_bar(aes(weight=lifeExp))+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=USAvalue),color="red",size=1) + labs(y="Average Life Expectancy",x = "Continent")+
  theme_minimal()
```
Red line indicates the USA life expectancy.

# Two Types of Categorical Data

--

- **Ordinal** data is data that is categorical in nature, but has a natural order.  The differences between levels may not be known.   
--

  ![:scale 30%](Presentation Images/likert.jpg)

--

- **Nominal** data is data that has no distinct order.

# Data Around You

- ### Think of a potential dataset that you would be interested in analyzing
  - #### What are the cases?
  - #### What are the variables?
  - #### What interesting questions could it help you answer?

---
