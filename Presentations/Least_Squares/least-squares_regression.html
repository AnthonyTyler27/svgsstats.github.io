# Least-Squares Regression
## Fitting a Line to Data
### 7.1 to 7.3 in OI and 6.1.2 through 6.1.4 in MD

# Regression Line

### A **regression line** is simply a line that describes how a response variable *y* changes as an explanatory variable *x* changes.   They are often used to predit the value of *y* for a given value of *x*
---
# Consider for a moment...

---
# So many possibilities...
![](least-squares_regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
#  Which line is the best one? 

## Ultimately, we want the line that lies closest to the points. 

--

## How do we measure how close a line falls to a set of points?

---
# Residuals

## A **residual** is the difference between an observed value of the response variable and the value predicted by the regression line. 


### $$ \text{residual} = \text{observed y} - \text{predicted y} $$

### $$ \text{residual} = y - \hat{y} $$

# Least-squares regression

### is so-named because the line that we choose is the line whose sum of the squares of these residuals is as small as possible.

# Interpreting a Regression Line

### A regression line is a **model** for the data.  The equation of the regression line gives a simple, compact mathematical description of what the model tells us about the relationship between our *explanatory variable* and our *response variable*. 

--

### Generally, our equations will follow the formula: 

### $$ \hat{y} = a + bx $$

- `\(\hat{y}\)` is the **predicted value** of the response variable *y* for a given value of the explanatory variable *x*. 
- `\(b\)` is the **slope**, the amount by which *y* is predicted to change when *x* increases by one unit. 
- `\(a\)` is the **y intercept**, the predicted value of *y* when *x = 0*

# Interpreting Slope

## For every one unit change in the x-variable (context), the y-variable is predicted to increase by *slope* (context).
---
class: center,inverse,middle

# Interpreting Y-intercept

## When the x variable (context) is zero, the y variable (context) is estimated to be *y-intercept*.

# Prediction


#### $$ \widehat{Longevity} = 8.008714 + 0.024363 \text{ Gestation} $$

A three-toed sloth has a gestational period of 183 days.  What is the predicted life expectancy?

--


#### $$ \widehat{Longevity} = 8.008714 + 0.024363 \cdot 183 = 12.5 \text{ years} $$
![:scale 70%](http://brdo.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
# Residuals

### A three-toed sloth's life expectancy is actually 17 years.  Calculate the residual associated with the three-toed sloth. 

--

#### $$ \text{Residual} = \text{actual life expectancy} - \text{predicted life expectancy} $$

#### $$ \text{Residual} = 17 - 12.5 = 4.5 \text{ years} $$


--

The actual life expectancy of the three-toed sloth is 4.5 years higher than the model predicts it to be.
---
# Extrapolation

### We can use a reression line to predict the response `\(\hat{y}\)` for a specific value of the explanatory variable *x*.  The accuracy of the prediction depends on how much the data scatter around the line. 

### While we *can* substitute any value of *x* into the equation of the regression line, we must exercise caution in making predictions outside the observed values of *x*.
