# Describing Scatterplots

### Must address direction, strength, and form in context.

---

# What is the correlation coefficient?

- ### Between -1 and 1. 
- ### Unit-less
- ### Can measure direction of relationship
- ### Can measure strength of the relationship

---
class: center, inverse

# Interpreting Slope

## For every one unit change in the x-variable (context), the y-variable is predicted to increase by *slope* (context).

--

## Slope gives us **more than just direction**.  It quantifies how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. 

---
class: center,inverse,middle

# Interpreting Y-intercept

## When the x variable (context) is zero, the y variable (context) is estimated to be *y-intercept*.

---
# Residuals

## A **residual** is the difference between an observed value of the response variable and the value predicted by the regression line. 


### $$ \text{residual} = \text{observed y} - \text{predicted y} $$

---
# Residual Plots

### A **residual plot** is a scatterplot of the residuals against the explanatory variable.  They help us assess how well a regression line fits the data. 

---
# Interpreting Residual Plots

### A residual plot magnifies the deviations of the points from the line, making it easier to see unusual observations and patterns. 

- The residual plot should show no obvious patterns (it should look random). 
- The residuals should be relatively small in size.

class: center,inverse,middle

# Any sort of pattern in the residuals is evidence that the current model is not appropriate. 
---
class: center, inverse,middle

# The **only** tool we've used for assessing whether a particular model is appropriate is the scatterplot and the residual plot. 


---
# Standard deviation of the residuals

### If we use a least-squares regression line to predict values of y given x, the **standard deviation of the residuals** measures the typical distance our actual y-values are from the model's predicted y values. 

---
# Formula Sentence

<p class="border inverse white tab">Predictions of <strong>y-variable</strong> using the model will vary from actual <strong>y-values</strong> on average by <strong>standard deviation of residuals</strong> units. </p>

---
# The role of $r^2$ in regression

### The standard deviation of the residuals gives us a numerical estimate in the units of y for the average size of our prediction errors. 

### $r^2$ is another numerical quantity that tells us how well the least-squares regression line predicts values of the response y.

--

### $r^2$, or the **coefficient of determination**, is the percentage of variation in the values of y that are accounted for by the model.

---
# When interpreting $r^2$

### Say - 

<p class = "inverse white tab border"> _____ percent of variation in the values of <strong>insert y variable here</strong> are accounted for by the linear model.</p>

---
# Multiple Regression

### How do you interpret the weight/slope on a variable in a multiple regression model?

<p class="inverse border white tab" >Taking all other variables in our model into account, for every increase in one unit of ________, there is a predicted (or associated) increase/decrease of ________ in ________ (y variable).</p>
